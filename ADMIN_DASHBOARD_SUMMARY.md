## API Routes Ready for Use

All CRUD operations are implemented and ready:

**Clients:**
- `GET /api/admin/clients` - List all
- `POST /api/admin/clients` - Create (auto-generates password)
- `GET /api/admin/clients/[id]` - Get one with pets
- `PUT /api/admin/clients/[id]` - Update
- `DELETE /api/admin/clients/[id]` - Delete with cascade

**Pets:**
- `GET /api/admin/pets` - List all
- `POST /api/admin/pets` - Create (validates client exists)
- `GET /api/admin/pets/[id]` - Get one
- `PUT /api/admin/pets/[id]` - Update
- `DELETE /api/admin/pets/[id]` - Delete

**Appointments:**
- `GET /api/admin/appointments` - List all
- `POST /api/admin/appointments` - Create (validates client and pet)
- `GET /api/admin/appointments/[id]` - Get one
- `PUT /api/admin/appointments/[id]` - Update
- `DELETE /api/admin/appointments/[id]` - Delete

## Testing Workflow

To test the complete system:

1. **Login to Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
   - Should see metrics and recent activity

2. **Create a Client**
   - Click "Add Client" from dashboard or clients page
   - Fill in: First Name, Last Name, Email (required)
   - Optional: Phone, Address, Notes
   - Submit → Client created with auto-generated password

3. **Add a Pet**
   - Go to Pets page
   - Click "Add Pet"
   - Select the client just created
   - Enter pet details (name, species, breed, DOB, weight, sex)
   - Submit → Pet associated with client

4. **Schedule an Appointment**
   - Go to Appointments page
   - Click "New Appointment"
   - Select client
   - Select pet (should be filtered to client's pets)
   - Choose type, date, time
   - Add notes
   - Submit → Appointment created

5. **Verify Dashboard Updates**
   - Return to dashboard
   - Should see updated metrics
   - New client should appear in "New Clients"
   - New appointment should appear in "Recent Appointments"

## Form Validation (Zod Schemas)

All API routes use Zod for validation:

**Client Schema:**
- email: valid email, required
- firstName: string, min 1 char, required
- lastName: string, min 1 char, required
- phone: string, optional
- address: object with street/city/postcode/country, optional
- password: string min 6 chars, optional (auto-generated if not provided)

**Pet Schema:**
- clientId: UUID, required
- name: string, min 1 char, required
- species: enum (dog/cat/other), required
- breed: string, min 1 char, required
- dateOfBirth: string (date), required
- weight: positive number, required
- sex: enum (male/female/neutered/spayed), required
- microchipId: string, optional
- insuranceDetails: object, optional
- photoUrl: valid URL, optional
- notes: string, optional

**Appointment Schema:**
- clientId: UUID, required
- petId: UUID, required (validated to belong to client)
- type: enum (initial-consultation/follow-up/diagnostic/treatment/emergency), required
- date: string (date), required
- time: string, required
- veterinarian: string, optional
- status: enum (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled), default pending
- notes: string, optional (visible to client)
- internalNotes: string, optional (admin-only)

## Success Notifications

All create/update/delete operations should show toast notifications:
- Success: "Client created successfully"
- Error: Display validation errors or "Failed to create client"
- Info: Show auto-generated password when applicable

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining view/edit pages listed above
2. Add form validation on client-side with react-hook-form
3. Test full workflow end-to-end
4. Add loading states and error boundaries
5. Consider adding:
   - Bulk operations (delete multiple)
   - Export to CSV
   - Advanced filtering (date ranges, etc.)
   - Calendar view for appointments
   - Email notifications for appointments

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: Redis KV (Upstash via @vercel/kv)
- **Authentication**: JWT with Redis sessions
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **UI Components**: Custom components + Lucide icons
- **Notifications**: Sonner (toast)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form (recommended for remaining pages)

## Performance Considerations

- All list pages use client-side search (no server-side pagination yet)
- Redis operations are fast but consider caching for large datasets
- Images/photos not optimized yet (use Next.js Image component)
- Consider adding skeleton loaders for better UX

## Security

- All admin routes protected with `requireAdminAuth()`
- API routes verify admin session
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiry
- HTTP-only cookies for session tokens
- Client-pet-appointment relationships validated
